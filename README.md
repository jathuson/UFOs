# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

Dana wanted to give a more in-depth examination of UFO encounters on her website. She wanted to do this by allowing viewers to search by multiple criteria at the same time. The following filters will be added to the website to meet this criteria: city, state, nation, shape, and date. 

## Results:
Searches can be done by entering any of the criteria (date, city, state, nation, shape of the UFO). To initiate a search, the user needs to enter the filter they want to search by in the example given for that specific field.

## Summary:
One of the drawbacks of the current webpage is that the user will need to know what filter values to use in order to filter the table. One way this can be addressed is to have a drop down menu where the user can select from the available data for that particular filter. This would help the user in deciding which filter to apply and what data is available for that filter. 

Another recommendation would be to use predictive text to make the search more efficient for the user. An additional filter could be added to search for keywords in the comments.
